## 📖 Project Overview

This Power BI project investigates how Artificial Intelligence has been adopted within global education systems over an 11-year period (2015–2026). The analysis spans **10 countries** across 5 regions — North America, Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa — and tracks student usage, teacher usage, school adoption rates, policy development, and socio-demographic indicators such as the urban/rural divide and gender gap.

The dataset captures three distinct phases of AI adoption in education:

|Phase|Period|Characteristics|
|-|-|-|
|**Foundational**|2015–2019|Low adoption (1%–25%), experimental usage, minimal policy|
|**Acceleration**|2020–2022|Surge driven by remote learning (25%–45% adoption)|
|**Integration**|2023–2026|AI becomes mainstream; teacher usage matches or exceeds student usage|

* **Clustered Bar Charts** — Compare AI adoption rates across countries and regions
* **Donut / Pie Charts** — Visualise top AI tool market share (ChatGPT \~27%, Microsoft Copilot \~25%, others \~48%)
* **KPI Cards** — Highlight headline metrics (e.g., peak adoption rates, average daily usage)
* **Maps** — Geographic distribution of AI adoption rates
* **Slicers / Filters** — Filter by Year, Country, Region, Season, and Policy Status

### 🧩 Custom Visuals (from .pbix)

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **The United States** began at just 1% student AI usage in 2015 and is projected to reach **63% by 2026**, the highest growth trajectory among Western nations.
2. **China** leads in teacher engagement, with **59% teacher usage** projected by April 2026, suggesting AI is deeply embedded in lesson planning and grading workflows.
3. **Nigeria** demonstrates the highest volatility but also one of the strongest growth arcs — reaching **64% student usage** by 2026 despite only 42% internet penetration.
4. **95.75% of customers are repeat users** of AI tools in education, indicating strong platform stickiness once adoption begins.
5. **Autumn is the peak season** for AI usage in education, likely driven by the start of academic calendars.
6. **Urban–Rural Divide:** Pakistan (60% urban vs. 47% rural) and India (62% urban vs. 48% rural) show the widest gaps as of January 2025.
7. **Gender Gap:** Narrowed significantly by 2026 (averaging 4–7%), but remains most pronounced in Brazil, China, and India during early adoption phases.
8. **Internet Penetration Correlation:** Countries with >90% internet penetration (USA, UK, Germany, Canada, Australia) reached 40% AI adoption faster than those below 50% (India, Pakistan, Nigeria).
9. **Teacher Usage Surpasses Students (2025–2026):** AI is increasingly used for administrative tasks (grading, lesson planning) rather than purely student-facing learning.
10. **Daily Usage Growth:** Average daily AI usage grew from \~10–20 minutes (2015) to \~30–50 minutes (2026), reflecting deeper integration into daily school routines.

## 🧮 DAX Measures

Below are sample DAX measures used in the report:

```dax
-- Total Student AI Usage (Average across all countries)
Avg Student Usage % =
AVERAGE(ai\_education\_usage\_global\_2015\_2026\[student\_ai\_usage\_pct])

-- Total Teacher AI Usage
Avg Teacher Usage % =
AVERAGE(ai\_education\_usage\_global\_2015\_2026\[teacher\_ai\_usage\_pct])

-- Year-over-Year Growth in Student Usage
YoY Student Growth % =
VAR CurrentYear = CALCULATE(AVERAGE(ai\_education\_usage\_global\_2015\_2026\[student\_ai\_usage\_pct]))
VAR PreviousYear = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(ai\_education\_usage\_global\_2015\_2026\[student\_ai\_usage\_pct]),
    DATEADD(ai\_education\_usage\_global\_2015\_2026\[year], -1, YEAR)
)
RETURN DIVIDE(CurrentYear - PreviousYear, PreviousYear, 0)

-- Urban-Rural Gap
Urban Rural Gap =
AVERAGE(ai\_education\_usage\_global\_2015\_2026\[urban\_ai\_usage\_pct]) -
AVERAGE(ai\_education\_usage\_global\_2015\_2026\[rural\_ai\_usage\_pct])

-- Policy Active Countries Count
Active Policy Countries =
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(ai\_education\_usage\_global\_2015\_2026\[country]),
    ai\_education\_usage\_global\_2015\_2026\[government\_ai\_policy] = "Active"
)
```
